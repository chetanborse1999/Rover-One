# Rover-One
A Rover platform based on a Rocker Bogie suspension.

## About Project
The project demonstrates the Rocker Bogie suspension used in Mars Rovers. The assembly enables the chassis to remain stable over uneven surfaces and improves traction in soft terrain like sand.

The robot has 6 wheels mounted on a servo that enables turning at variable turning radius, spot turns and strafing. The Rocker-Bogie assembly on each side is connected via a differential bar that maintains the chassis pitch on uneven surfaces. The chassis maintains an average pitch of both rockers.

The robot has 6 Johnson motors and 6 MG995 servos powered by a Lithium Polymer battery. The actuators are controlled by Arduino Mega2560 and L298N H-bridge motor drivers. For communication, FS-i6/FS-ia6b radio transmitter/receiver is used. 

## CAD Model
Designed in Fusion360. Files are included. The chassis is made of 3x2 (35mmx23mm) aluminium tube. The remaining parts are 3d printed.
